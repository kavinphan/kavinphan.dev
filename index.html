        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>
          <b>Hey there, I'm Kavin!</b> I work as a full-time software engineer
          at
          <a href="https://grayscaleapp.com/" class="grayscale-text"
            >Grayscale</a
          >, a startup based in Atlanta, GA, where I have worn many hats
          including front-end, back-end, dev-ops, and site reliability. I have
          led projects to develop integrations with HRIS platforms like
          <b>Workday</b> and <b>SAP SuccessFactors</b> and contributed to
          efforts like moving our services from <b>Heroku</b> to <b>AWS</b> and
          supporting <b>multi-region deployments</b>. I am also a part-time
          student at the
          <a href="https://www.gatech.edu/" class="gt-text"
            >Georgia Institute of Technology</a
          >
          where I will be graduating in May 2025 with a B.S. in Computer
          Science. At Georgia Tech I am involved with
          <a href="https://bitsofgood.org/" class="bog-text">Bits of Good</a>, a
          club that develops pro-bono software for non-profits. I have served
          the club as a developer, engineering manager, and even director of
          engineering.
        </p>

        <br />

        <p>
          Outside of work and school, I take care of my three cats and enjoy
          making music!
